# Paul's Guitar Shop 🎸

A fun and heartfelt site I built for my hometown guitar shop — [Paul's Guitar Shop](https://paulsguitarshop.com). Paul is a local legend and all-around great guy, and this project was a blast to work on. I wanted to give his shop a fresh digital presence that matched the vibe of the store: welcoming, down-to-earth, and passionate about guitars.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

This site was built with:

- **Vue 3** — using the Composition API
- **Vite** — for lightning-fast builds and dev experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — for utility-first, responsive design
- **Netlify** — for simple and fast deployment
- **Pinia** — for state management (simple but effective for this use case)

Bonus: The site uses **lazy loading**, **mobile-first responsiveness**, and **semantic HTML** for good performance and accessibility.
